                I Thelma Morgan was born in a small town Sanford, Conejos, Colorado on 2 January 1911, a cold day the ninth child of seven living children, five boys and one (1) sister. The oldest brother, James William ded a few weeks after birth, my mother was very sad at the loss of her baby. When Geneva the other sister, nin years old died of diptheria mother and family had been under quarantien for six weeks. When Geneva died my mother told me that when she had to dress that dead child and have her held up to the window to be seen was the hardest thing she had ever done. Mother was grief stricken over this, later another baby was born, a boy, Charles, but mother wanted another girl so she took bottle after bottle of Lydia pink compound to get pregnant after so long a time she finally got pregnant. There was never any doubt in her mind that I would not be a girl. Mother was in the change of life and was 41 years of age. When I arrived all the family was very happy. Mama was in labor a long time. The children stayed in the kitchen. All were worried she was sick so long. Daddy finally came and told them. When they finally found they had a baby sister (afraid I turned out to be a disappointment to them) not really I was really loved by all. I was blessed on February 17, 1011 by Eprhaim Mortensen in Sanford, Conejos, Colorado. One time as a baby, Edna and Lawrence each thought the other had me so therefore I was picked up off the floor un hurt. I gave my mother a bad time. I was always running away, we lived across the street from a canal nd it was usually full of water. Mama was always afraid I'd fall in. One of my very earliest recolections was going out in the garden to play and fell asleep between the rows in the garden. Mama was frantic. One day a neighbor boy that I played with, Frank Saule, we ran off. I remember going to an old vcant house and Frank and I werer sitting in the window when we were found. (We were very very young) When I started school I was sick so mucy. (School was held in a small building somwhere close) Mrs. Saule was the teacher but because I was sick so much I didn't pas, the next year school was held in a big red brick building.

                Frank Saul, Sr. was the superindentent, high school was held upstairs in the building. Mrs. Saul was the teacher again. I remember she would make letters with chalk on our desks and give us red beans to put on the ltters to learn. She would have a nice table with sand and glass over it. Would fix up the sand table withdifferent things. I thought this wonderful. In my second year Almira Brothers ws the teacher, don't remember too much of the year she was very strict. We got down to work by this time. Would like to tell about the rest rooms. It was quite a novelty for me to have indoor toilets we went down a number of steps into a big room where we would gather nd play jacks on a cement floor ws a nice cool place for jump rope and jacks my first girl fiend was Cara Fredericksen she lived about a block from our house we licked to dress up in my sisters clothes and high button shoes we always had a play house we had a lot of Box Elder shade trees they would put out long shoots it was annoying these trees for our play houses stores etc were made. I always liked dolls and cats as I was called cat sister by brothers I would put the cats in the doll buggy and push them around. At Christmas the town held a community Christmas in the tivola. There would be a progrm always a big decorated tree on the stage each family would put one present on the tree for ech small child. That is were I got my doll buggy. Remember pushing it home afterwards. Always liked to play paper dolls cut out of catalogues kept them in boxes behind the books in book case once in a while Edna would clean and throw some away had so many never missed them. Always loved Primary it was always held on Monday after school. we would learn so many things about Joseph Smith and do so many things Melva and Marba Jensen was a couple of teachers they were the bishop's daughters. Always enjoyed the programs they put on at the tivolo a big building the church built in 1894 for dancing, programs, basketball shows of all kind of entertainment the building was round with seats all around it the floor ad springs nice for adnacing. It consisted of two dressing rooms a stage, bowling alley, soda foountain, hat check rooms also a room for movie picture film etc. The Primary would have a big maypole in center of building the larger children would dance around it and braid always enojyed this especially if I got to dance with Frank Saule when ever we had a special day (I always had a new dress for these occassions) like the 4<sup>th</sup> of July and 24 July it was called Pioneer day we would wake up to the sound of cannon balls going off. the day consisted of a parade Daddy always drove the covered wagon and Grandma Jensen rode with him as long as she was able (this was before I was born)

                Then we would meet at church house for talks and songs. after dinner there was always a childrens dance at the Tivoli what fun then ball game races games etc at night a dance for adults. I remember once I was given a dime I ask if I could spend the whole thing how grateful I was. About the only way I would get to by candy was Mama would give me an egg sometimes two depending on the price of eggs. I would always take some candy home to her. Frank Saule and I continued to be friends we would always share our candy I never went with Frank as a boyfriend (he was ust a friend) we would be a bunch together but I usually went with Merle Hutchins a cousin that lived with his uncle and auNt. a cousin of Troy Hutchins a friend in the crowd. We lived the north end of town there was lots of sagebrush a bunch of us kids would get together at night and build a big camp fire and play games one I especially liked was run sheep run. Sometimes we would roast potatoes. I cannot write this without mentioning one neighbor boy Clatyon Peterson he was  thorn in my side always. one night at the camp fire he threw black pepper in my eyes all though my school time he would hurt and do mean things call me names the wre not always nice. So many times Frank would make him quit and come to my rescue usually we walked home together. About this time some new neighbors moved into Granny Creamers house a girl my age we would come and go to school together she knewe how to ballet dance hadsome of the slippers and helped me learn boy I practced until I finally learned how I woud use her slippers fter I learned.

                We always went to Sunday School and church on Sundays in the afternoon a bunch of us girls would write and practice plays we would put sheets or blankets up for our curtains we would put on these plays sometimes I would dnce. our underwear wsn't always the nicest our bloomers (panties) were made out of flour sacks elastic at top full legs with elastic I remember one time Carrie Irwin had remarked it wasn't everyone that had pnsies on her seat (it was pnsy flour we had) which she did. I remember my first pair of ought apnties they were a blue knit with several rows of elastic on bnd and they were wore below the knees. as we were older would put on plays at school during the noon hour for the small children. Back to school when I was in third grade Jane Crowther was the teacher as I remember it was a hard year. I always hated arithmetic and got poor grades. Jane was a very sweet teacher really loved her. we usually there in sanford would go on an outing the last day of school someties we would go upon the Conejos River and other times would go in wgons to Saddle Back Mt. east of town. one time the boys found some thistle weeds and hit us girls on the legs I can still remember how red and how they hurt when there was water we girls would go swimming in our underwear some times they were long arms, legs as we grew older they were shorter anyway we would then take them off and put the wet undies in our lunch pails. As I remember the water was cold as would be up there the last of May. I never heard mama say anything but she had to know.
