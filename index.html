                <b>To One in Paradise</b>
                <br>
                by Edgar Allan Poe
                <p>
                    Thou wast that all to me, love,<br>
                    For which my soul did pine—<br>
                    A green isle in the sea, love,<br>
                    A fountain and a shrine,<br>
                    All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,<br>
                    And all the flowers were mine.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ah, dream too bright to last!<br>
                    Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise<br>
                    But to be overcast!<br>
                    A voice from out the Future cries,<br>
                    “On! on!”—but o’er the Past<br>
                    (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies<br>
                    Mute, motionless, aghast!<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    For, alas! alas! with me<br>
                    The light of Life is o’er!<br>
                    No more—no more—no more—<br>
                    (Such language holds the solemn sea<br>
                    To the sands upon the shore)<br>
                    Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,<br>
                    Or the stricken eagle soar!<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    And all my days are trances,<br>
                    And all my nightly dreams<br>
                    Are where thy grey eye glances,<br>
                    And where thy footstep gleams—<br>
                    In what ethereal dances,<br>
                    By what eternal streams.</p>
