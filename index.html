                For my final project, I chose to research how the internet has affected genealogical research. I will include how genealogy was done prior to the internet, once the internet became available, and what the future could hold for genealogical research. Before we begin, I want to highlight a few things about genealogy. I'm not going to spend time on these, it's not the purpose of my research.
